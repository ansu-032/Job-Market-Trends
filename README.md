# Job-Market-Trends
PYTHON / PANDAS,NUMPY,MATPLOTLIB,SEABORN / POWER-BI

This report delves into the job market trends over the past five years, based on a robust dataset of job positions, salaries, and related factors from 2020 to 2024. Key areas of exploration include:
 -> Salary Distributions: Understanding the central tendency and dispersion of salary data through mean, median, and standard deviation calculations.
 ->Remote Work Trends: Examining the shift towards remote work and its impact on compensation.
 ->Experience Level Impact: Analyzing how different experience levels affect salary packages.
 -> Geographic Influence: Investigating how company locations in various cities and countries influence salaries.

To ensure accurate and insightful analysis, I used Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and processing.
Descriptive statistics were computed to highlight key trends, and data visualization techniques (matplotlib, seaborn) were employed to reveal patterns and insights visually.
